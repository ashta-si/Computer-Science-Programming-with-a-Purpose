Here’s a **simple checklist** you can keep next to you while studying or doing Coursera assignments with ChatGPT.

# ✅ Safe AI Use Checklist (Coursera / Exams / Assignments)

### 📌 Before Asking ChatGPT

* [ ] Did I try solving the question myself first?
* [ ] Did I write down my reasoning, even if incomplete?

---

### 📌 When Using ChatGPT

* [ ] Am I asking for **explanations** (why/how) instead of just the answer?
* [ ] Am I treating ChatGPT like a **teacher/tutor**, not as a shortcut?

---

### 📌 After Getting ChatGPT’s Answer

* [ ] Do I understand the explanation in my own words?
* [ ] Can I explain it without looking at ChatGPT?
* [ ] Did I compare it with my original attempt to find mistakes?

---

### 📌 Before Submitting to Coursera

* [ ] Did I **rewrite the answer in my own words**?
* [ ] Does my submission reflect **my reasoning** instead of AI’s exact wording?
* [ ] If someone asked me to explain verbally, could I do it?

---

### 🚦 Golden Test

* If it looks like **notes you learned from**, ✅ it’s safe.
* If it looks like **copy-paste from ChatGPT**, ❌ it’s not safe.

Would you like me to also make this checklist into a **one-page PDF** you can print or keep open while doing Coursera work, so it’s always in front of you?
