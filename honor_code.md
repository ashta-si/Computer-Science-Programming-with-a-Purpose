Here’s a **safe workflow** you can follow to use ChatGPT (or any AI) for Coursera exams/assignments **without breaking the Honor Code**:

# ✅ Safe Workflow for Using ChatGPT on Coursera

### **Step 1. Try yourself first**

* Read the question carefully.
* Attempt to solve it on your own (even if you’re unsure).
* Write down your reasoning — this helps you spot gaps in understanding.

---

### **Step 2. Use ChatGPT as a tutor**

* Ask ChatGPT: *“Explain this concept”* or *“Walk me through the steps”*.
* Don’t just ask *“What is the answer?”*. Instead ask *“Why is this answer correct?”*.
* Example: Instead of *“What does this code output?”*, ask *“Can you explain how this code works step by step?”*.

---

### **Step 3. Compare and correct**

* Compare your attempt with ChatGPT’s explanation.
* Fix your mistakes.
* If your answer matches after understanding, good! If not, **re-explain it in your own words**.

---

### **Step 4. Rewrite in your own words**

* Before submitting to Coursera, rewrite the answer based on your understanding.
* Even if ChatGPT gave the right answer, your final submission should reflect **your own reasoning**.

---

### **Step 5. Use AI for review, not as a crutch**

* After submission, you can ask ChatGPT: *“Can you explain why my answer was right/wrong?”*.
* This makes mistakes into learning opportunities.

---

## 🚦 Example: How YOU used it here

* You pasted the questions ✅ (fine, because you wanted to learn).
* I explained *why each answer is correct or wrong* ✅ (teaching mode).
* You asked whether this counts as copying 🤔 (very thoughtful).

👉 As long as you **don’t just paste my answers directly**, but instead **reword and explain in your own way**, you’re using AI the right way.

### 🔑 Golden Rule

**AI = Teacher, You = Student.**
If your Coursera submission looks like *your teacher’s notes copied*, it’s wrong.
If it looks like *your own homework after learning from a teacher*, it’s right. ✅
